# deadlock-builder

This project is being split into two sub folders:
- char-buidler

A web version of the already seen in game Character Builder providing stats and 'real time' updates to builds so you can edit builds without needing to be in game - ability to share will be a WIP
- items

This serves as both a reference for the char-builder but also for another project that I will be working on which will have git-ignores till I am satisfied with the project
