# Godot Projects

These are Personal Projects that I am working on using the Godot Engine.

As of creation there are two: 20 Games Challenge and Blinxelator.

20 Games Challenge is using the following URL, https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/ , in order to teach myself more about Godot and coding.

Blinxelator is a means to taking an image and pixelating it down to specific settings in order to enable bead art work. This is a current WIP projkect due to the nature of me not knowing enough about systems that need to be used in order to complete this project.
