turningRadius = (Wheelbase/sin(steering angle)) + (tire width/2)

Acceleration:

Force = Mass * Acceleration
Acceleration = (Engine Force - Drag Force - Rolling Resistance) / Mass


Drag Force:

Drag Force = 0.5 * Air Density * Drag Coefficient * Frontal Area * Velocity ^ 2


Rolling Resistance:

Rolling Resistance = Rolling Resistance Coefficient * Vehicle Weight


Braking Distance:

Braking Distance = (Initial Velocity ^ 2) / (2 * Deceleration)


Lateral Force(Cornering):

Lateral Force = Mass * Velocity ^ 2 / Radius of Turn


Weight Transfer:

Longitudinal Weight Transfer = (Mass * Acceleration * Center of Gravity Height) / Wheelbase
Lateral Weight Transfer = (Mass * Lateral Acceleration * Center of Gravity Height) / Track Width


Tire Friction:

Friction Force = Normal Force * Friction Coefficient


Suspension:

Spring Force = Spring Constant * Displacement
Damping Force = Damping Coefficient * Velocity


Engine Torque and Power:

Power = Torque * Angular Velocity
Torque at wheels = Engine Torque * Gear Ratio * Differential Ratio


Top Speed:

Top Speed = (Engine Power * Transmission Efficiency) / (Drag Coefficient * Frontal Area * Air Density)


Oversteer and Understeer:

Understeer Gradient = (Front Lateral Load Transfer / Front Lateral Acceleration) - (Rear Lateral Load Transfer / Rear Lateral Acceleration)


Downforce:

Downforce = 0.5 * Air Density * Downforce Coefficient * Frontal Area * Velocity ^ 2
