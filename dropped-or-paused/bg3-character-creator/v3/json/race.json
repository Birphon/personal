				"Description": "The Dragonborn race are descendants of dragons and share many of their traits and racial features. They possess the Draconic Ancestry that allows them to breathe fire, acids, lightning, poison, ice, and others. Each Dragonborn corresponds to the ten types of dragons that you can find in Dungeons and Dragons. The Dragonborns possess the Breath Weapon which gives them the power to breathe destructive energy. The damage dealt in an area is based on the ancestry, and players may only use this attack once until they complete a long rest. The Dragonborn race is distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. This will determine the type of damage, the area of the Breath Weapon, and the type of resistance gained.",
