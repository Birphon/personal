# DROPPED

Using Ironsworn based on its Free TTRPG files to make a game within Godot to continue developing skills in Godot and to keep my mind active with Software development while finding full time work.

## This has been dropped
As you can see, this project has been dropped even before it was really started. Ironsworn was pitched on the research that I did as TTRPG with three modes: Solo, Co-op, GM. With Solo and Co-op not featuring a GM but instead using an Oracle based system (events on a sheet then a dice is rolled for said events) which, to me, sounds like it removes a lot of the "Roleplaying" from RPGs - weird to say, I don't really like the Roleplay in games, mainly due to the fact that I couldn't care less about the 20 minutes of fluff that can be found when playing TTRPGs or the fact Generic NPC #43798056 has sometime to say for Generic Fetch Quest #4325 that I am doing within a video game... Its actually why I like video game RPGs cause I can just skip Dialogue and do quests.

Well, it was brought to my attention that Ironswon is HEAVILY Roleplaying focused. RIP this project
