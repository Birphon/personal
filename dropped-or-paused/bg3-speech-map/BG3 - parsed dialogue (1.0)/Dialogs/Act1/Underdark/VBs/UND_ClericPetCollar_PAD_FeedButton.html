Pressing the button while wearing Cleric pet's collar drops food (currently blue cheese). Kind of auto-feeding device.<br>This PAD happens on button press. There're variants: player who pressed button wears the collar, and so it just works. Player has it in pocket, then the collar vibrates a little.
