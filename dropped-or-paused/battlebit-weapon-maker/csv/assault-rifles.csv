AK74,Preference,Preference,Suppressor | Heavy | **Long**,Gun Fighter | SE5 | **B25 URK**,Quick-A,Meh gun
M4A1,Preference | **StrikeFire**,Preference,Heavy | Long | **Tactical**,Gun Fighter | **B25 URK**,Quick-A,Turn into Lazer
AK15,Preference,Preference,Heavy | **Long** | Tactical,GunFigher | **B25 URK**,Quick-A,Meh gun 2.0 - Okay in singleshot with headshots but like might as well DMR or Sniper right
SCAR-H,Preference | **StrikeFire**,Preference,Tactical,**Gun Fighter** | SE5,None,Ironicly worse AK15 because of Reload Speed - if this was changed up so either there was a default lower Reload or the mags were better. the SCARH becomes better
AUG A3,Preference | **StrikeFire**,Preference,Suppressor, **B25 URK**,Quick-A,Weird gun - use if you are flanking a lot
SG550,Preference,Preference,Tactical | **FlashHider**,Gun Fighter | **B25 URK**,None,Weaker AK74 | M4A1 sure higher ROF lower recoil but more hits needed
FAMAS,Preference,Preference,Long, **B25 URK**,Quick-A,All the homies hate the FAMAS - is an SMG trying ti be an assault rifle and doing really really bad at it. Starter SMGs are better LMAO
ARC,Preference,Preference,Tactical, **B25 URK**,Quick-B,Low Damage Meh ROF - M4A1 over this
G36C,Preference,Preference,Long,Verticle Grip,Quick-A,yeah it good
HK419,Preference | **StrikeFire**,Preference,Long, **B25 URK**,Quick-A,M4A1 upgrade basically - Muzzle Flash can be a bit annoying but replacing long isn't the greatest
FAL,Preference,Preference,Heavy | Long,Gun Fighter | **B25 URK**,Quick-A,Better AK15
AK5C,Preference,Preference,Heavy, **B25 URK**,Doesn't Exist,This is the M4A1 at Rank 145
