The Khan Academy for League Of Legends based on Deep League (Mathew Knipfer) video's

My goal here is to use my knowledge of HTML, Bootstrap yoinking and JavaScript to make an Interactive Website that gets updated with every LoL patch based on Deep Leauge's videos.
Deep Leauge is delving into the mathematics of how the globally popular massively multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game Leauge Of Legends works. With these video's I plan of using his knowledge to make an Website that everyone can use to get all the information, linking through Deep Leauge's videos, on the game and how the mathematically build champions.

This all started due to Mathew sending an Email to a YouTube by the name of RossBoomsocks (The Scottish Faker) which he had released a video called "Mathematical Pantheon" which might have been a "cheesy badass damage build" but not only set the comments on fire but also changed how the game was viewed and how Mathematical Pantheon rised up in populatirty and became Pantheon's main build.

Within this website I want to textually cover what Mathew covers in his videos, referencing his videos and showing examples both from the LoL Wiki and Interactive Examples, as well as showing all the mathematics behind the game. I hope that this can be updated every Patch and that it allows players to generate new paths for champions to walk down

I hope to keep this website an open source website to allow players to make sure everything is functioning correctly, making sure updates for the game are being updated here and also allowing people to see my design pathway, how I created this project and see my thought process.
Programs that will be needed:
1) Text Editor - I personally use VS Code purely for the Workspace feature and extensions I can have added - List of extensions can be seen in the VSC_Extentions.md
2) Adobe XD - This is a free program made by Adobe which is downloaded via their Adobe Creative Cloud - XD is an amazing Wireframe and Prototyping design tool -- EDIT: Well, Adobe yeeted this into their Starter Plan so something else will need to be used!
