            <p>
                <b>Trade backpacks</b>
                - a special STALCRAFT game mechanic In many bases, you can find a Supplier NPC
                who will offer you to buy a backpack with unknown contents and deliver it to the recipient. When you
                buy
                a backpack, it is equipped, and the only way to get rid of it is to deliver it, throw it away or
                lose
                it. As a reward for the delivery, you will receive reputation points, money, barter resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Daily Quests</b> - a special STALCRAFT game mechanic In many bases, you can find a Quest Board. A
                number of quests will be shown with the return values. As a reward for the delivery, you will receive
                reputation points, money, barter resources
                <br>
                There are a couple of items that players have issue finding:<br>
                Crackers<br>These are found after completing the Military Outposts<br>[Item]<br>These are found after
                completing
                the Animal Den/Nest's
                <br><br>
                Players also struggle to find where to deliever these quest items - Talk to NPC's around the base where
                you recieved the quest and there should be someone with a Dialouge talking about an Ad - This is
                generally the <b>Merchant of Supplies</b>
            </p>

        <h3>It is important to know </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The backpack drops when you die and exit the game, so you have to be very careful and repel any attack.
                You can ask your friends to help you, find like-minded people to deliver the goods.</li>

            <li>The player who picks up someone else's cargo and delivers it to the nearest supplier receives a reward 2
                times less than due to the player who bought this cargo, for this they also give an achievement called
                "Gop-stop" .</li>

            <li>On the lost backpack, the nickname of the one who carried the backpack is indicated, so if you lost it,
                you can easily find it.</li>

            <li>Contracts for backpacks are updated once a day.</li>

            <li>A contract that is too complex can be canceled and then it will appear after 16 hours.</li>

            <li>With the improvement of the reputation at the base, more complex delivery contracts are opened.</li>
        </ul>
