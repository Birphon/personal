            <h2>Anomalies</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Anomalies</b> are formations of an unknown nature that appeared in the Zone after the second
                explosion. They represent a great danger to the health and life of any living creature, but they form an
                artifact, which makes many stalkers investigate them.

        <h2>Biochemical</h2>
        <p id="Kissel">
        <h3>Kissel</h3>

        A dangerous anomaly of a biochemical nature. It looks like a luminous bright green liquid, clearly visible
        in the dark. Upon contact with the body, it inflicts injuries similar to the effect of exposure to a strong
        acid. In a suit with a closed breathing cycle, damage will be minimal. In this anomaly, strange chemical
        processes take place non-stop. Their result is an acid that corrodes the skin, and poisonous gases that
        corrode the lungs with equal success. Even in passive mode, the anomaly produces a dim green light and is
        easy to spot even in the dark. When interacting with any object, it hisses strongly, so it can also be
        detected with bolts.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Thermal">
        <h2>Thermal</h2>
        <p id="Frying">
        <h3>Frying</h3>In the inactive state, it looks like a barely visible cloud of hot air, but when it enters the
        zone of action of any object or living being, it forms a compact zone that looks like a jet of fire and is
        heated to a temperature of about 1500K (1227 Â° C). The frying itself is a jet of burning gas. The anomaly is
        activated when any object hits, so it can be detected by throwing bolts both day and night.</p>
        <p id="Steam">
        <h3>Steam</h3>Thermal anomaly. It is a jet of red-hot thick white steam escaping from the ground. The anomaly is
        active all the time, so it is easily detected and does not pose a serious danger.</p>
        <p id="Cirus">
        <h3>The Cirus</h3>A complex anomaly of a thermal nature, which is a circle with a diameter of about ten meters,
        along which several so-called "Comets", or wandering fries, are circling. In the center is constantly active
        frying. Perhaps the anomaly is also of a mental nature - sometimes Comets do not burn a creature that gets in
        their way, do not produce heat, and are not fixed by scientific equipment. This hints that some "Comets" may be
        a collective hallucination of observers. The anomaly is active all the time, so it is easy to detect. However,
        her damage radius can change, so it's best to avoid her.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Electrial">
        <h2>Electrophysical</h2>
        <p id="Elektra">
        <h3>Elektra</h3>An anomalous formation of an electrical nature with a diameter of about three meters,
        accumulating static electricity. A disturbed anomaly explodes with a dozen mini-lightnings, and an electric
        shock for any living creature is almost always fatal. A characteristic feature of the "Electra" is the bluish
        light visible above it during the day. The anomaly is easily distinguishable at any time of the day: during the
        day it can be identified by blue fog and small lightning, sometimes slipping through the air, and at night - by
        a glow or a throw of a metal object. You can also hear characteristic crackling sounds.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Gravitational">
        <h2>Gravitational</h2>
        <p id="Black_Hole">
        <h3>Black Hole</h3>An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. At the moment of activation, with terrible
        force, it draws in everything that is within a radius of three to four meters. If it hits the center of the
        anomaly, there is no chance of survival: the body of both the animal and the person will be compressed into a
        tight lump, and then torn apart at the moment of the so-called discharge. Does not change the place of its
        manifestation. An anomaly can be visually detected during the day by the characteristic movement of air above it
        and swirling foliage. It is extremely dangerous at night, as it is detected only by throwing metal objects.</p>
        <p id="Vortex">
        <h3>Vortex</h3>Gravitational anomaly; lifts the victim into the air, spins it and causes severe physical damage.
        Survivors after falling into this anomaly say that the anomaly seemed to "periodically beat them with a large
        blunt object." It is very important not to miss the moment of the beginning of being drawn into the anomalous
        vortex and not to fall into the zone of the strongest effect in the center - only then there is a chance to get
        off with minimal injuries. Detected by a light dust whirlwind. Most likely, the anomaly does not react to
        inanimate objects. If you throw a bolt into the Vortex, then a rainbow glare will appear at the boundary of the
        impact, and the bolt will bounce a certain distance.</p>
        <p id="Trampoline">
        <h3>Trampoline</h3>One of the first recorded anomalies. Inflicts impact damage with an alternating gravity
        field. The result of a meeting with a "trampoline" can be different - from small bruises and bruises to instant
        death. In the daytime, it is quite easily detected by the distortion of the air above it. It is fixed with the
        help of various objects thrown into it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Nascent"></section>
    <h2>Nascent Anomalies</h2>
    <p>This is a special type of anomaly that can only be detected using the SAK-1 or SAK-2 wide range detectors. The
        main purpose of such anomalies is to extract artifacts from them using special anomalous installations. As well
        as ready-made anomalies, there are four types, and therefore the corresponding artifacts fall out of them.
        Despite the fact that it is just emerging, it still beats painfully, so itâs not worth climbing into this one.
    </p>
    <section id="Other">
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p id="Space_Bubble">
        <h3>Space Bubble</h3>A spherical translucent formation that has the ability to instantly transfer matter from
        one point in space to another. Any object or part of it, falling into the scope of the anomaly (entry point),
        instantly âfalls outâ from the reverse side (exit point), but it is not known where this reverse side will end
        up. The exact mechanism of action of this phenomenon of the Zone has not been studied, which is due to the
        rather rare appearance of this anomaly and its unpredictability in relation to experimenters.\n\n The anomaly is
        clearly visible at any time of the day. Since it does not pose a direct danger, it does not require special
        designation measures.</p>
        <p id="Mirror">
        <h3>Mirror</h3>The anomaly has not been fully explored. Upon impact, the subject begins to tear from the inside
        with every movement. "As if the guy had been smashed like a mirror" - Beard.<br>This anomaly is found only in
        "Limansk" and is poorly visible at any time of the day. When hit in the "Mirror", an effect appears on the
        screen that disappears over time.</p>
        <p id="Stagnation">
        <h3>Stagnation</h3>A cloudy hemisphere, imperceptible at rest and significantly slowing down all processes in
        the human body that has fallen into it. Delay in the anomaly results in death. In the inactive state, it can be
        detected by a slight wave distortion emanating from the center.</p>
